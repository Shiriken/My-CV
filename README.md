# My Personal Portfolio Website - README

## Project Analysis

### User Profile
I'm Luis, an 18-year-old passionate video game designer and programmer. My goal with this portfolio is to showcase my skills and experience to potential employers, clients, and collaborators. As someone who enjoys creating innovative games and user-friendly web designs, I wanted this site to be a professional, yet approachable way for people to learn about my work. My strengths lie in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and design tools like Photoshop, which I’ve applied to projects in game development and web design. I created this site to share my journey and give a glimpse of my abilities.

### Information Architecture
I’ve organized the website into six main sections to make it easy to navigate. At the top, the Header introduces me with my name and profession. Next is the Bio section, where I share a bit about myself and include a profile photo to make it personal. Then, the Skills section lists my main technical skills, which I arranged in a way that’s simple to scan. The Experience section details my professional background, showcasing my roles at Rockstar and Google to build credibility. In the Portfolio section, I added clickable links to projects I’ve worked on, so viewers can see my work directly. Finally, the Footer includes my contact information to make it easy for anyone interested to reach out. I focused on clarity and accessibility so visitors could easily get to know me and my work.

### Visual Design
For the visual design, I went with a clean and professional look. I chose a deep blue color for the header and footer to give the site a polished feel, contrasting it with white and light blues in the main content to keep it light and easy on the eyes. The typography is classic and straightforward, using a sans-serif font that feels modern yet professional. For headings and links, I added a bright blue accent color to make key areas stand out. The profile photo and icons in the skills section help break up the content, making it feel more personal and visually engaging. I also added hover effects on the portfolio links to add a bit of interactivity, showing my attention to detail. Overall, I aimed for a design that reflects my style and professional goals as a creative developer.
